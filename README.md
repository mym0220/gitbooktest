=============

# Installing Ricty fonts

```

$ brew install ricty
# (generate)
$ cp -f /PATH/TO/RICTY/fonts/Ricty*.ttf ~/Library/Fonts/
$ fc-cache -vf
```

# Troubleshooting

## I get a Python error during `brew install fontforge`

If you get an error during `brew install fontforge`, like below:

```
==> Patching
==> ./bootstrap
==> ./configure --prefix=/Users/sane/.homebrew/Cellar/fontforge/20141230 --disable-silent-rules --without-x --without-giflib --without-libspiro
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables PYTHON_CFLAGS
and PYTHON_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
```

### Quick fix (work around)

Execute the following:

```
# Install python before installing fontforge and ricty
brew install python
# Then install fontforge and ricty
brew install ricty
```

### Long help (my environment)

I use homebrew of course, but I don't use homebrew's python. I use pyenv via anyenv. In the homebrew build script, your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` is not used; there is homebrew's `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. You can try this `brew sh` and `printenv | grep PKG_CONFIG_PATH`.

The [fontforge configuration script](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/blob/7432f9a102f0f4268c5caabbb4f55d3ac33b0d0d/configure.ac#L217-L230) doesn't detect pyenv's python (I think, but I'm not famliar with autoconf yet, sorry). I don't understand why this doesn't detect the system python (after I execute `pyenv global system`).

The following is the debug output of `brew install fontforge --verbose --debug`:

```

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables PYTHON_CFLAGS
and PYTHON_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
```

The actual solution is detecting system python here, but I don't know how to detect this yet.
